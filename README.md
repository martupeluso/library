# Library

First project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s JavaScript Course: a simple book tracker.

This page lets users add books, mark them as read, and remove them. The goal of this project was to practice working with objects and object constructors.

> Note: localStorage wasn't required at this stage.
